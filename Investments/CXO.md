# Core Lithium (CXO.AX) - Full Growth Analysis
**Date:** 2026-02-17
**Status:** Binary Recovery Play (Care & Maintenance)

## Phase 1: Consensus & Price Context
- **Price Action:** ~$0.197 (Down ~12% over 90 days). It's been hovering in a tight range as the market waits for a lithium price floor.
- **Valuation Compression:** We're seeing a clear signal of valuation compression. The forward P/E of **~9.8x** looks cheap on paper, but it's highly sensitive to the +1 year revenue estimate of **$146M**, which assumes a restart or significant ramp-up in sales.
- **Momentum:** EPS revisions for the next year have been ticking **upwards** recently, suggesting analysts think the worst of the "care and maintenance" pain is priced in.

## Phase 2: The Deep Dive (Financials)
- **Cash Position:** As of the last major report (June 2025/Dec 2025 context), CXO has roughly **$24M–$30M** in cash and equivalents. This is significantly down from the $80M+ they had a year ago, reflecting the cost of keeping Finniss on ice and ongoing exploration.
- **Liabilities:** Total debt remains very low (**$2.9M**), which is their saving grace. They aren't under immediate pressure from lenders, but the burn rate for exploration and maintenance is the clock they're racing against.
- **Asset Value:** Tangible Book Value is around **$234M**, which is about 45% of the current market cap. You’re essentially paying a $290M premium for the "optionality" of a lithium price recovery and their gold exploration.

## Phase 3 & 4: The Mosaic (Lithium & Gold)
- **The Lithium Catalyst:** Spodumene price forecasts for 2026/2027 are being revised up to **$1,100–$1,200/t** (from ~$900/t). CXO needs these higher prices to make a Finniss restart economically viable.
- **The "Gold" Hedge:** Their recent pivot toward gold exploration at **Shoobridge** is a smart play to keep the lights on. High-grade gold results are a diversification tool while the lithium market works through its surplus.

## Phase 5: Jarvis’ Decision Support (Thesis Variance)
- **The Bull Case:** You believe the lithium market will move into deficit by late 2026/early 2027 (sooner than the consensus of 2028). In this scenario, CXO is a high-leverage play that could re-rate significantly as soon as a restart is announced.
- **The Bear Case:** Lithium prices stay "lower for longer," and CXO is forced to do a capital raise at these low prices to fund the BP33 development, diluting existing shareholders.

## Conclusion
CXO is currently a **"Binary Recovery"** play. It's not a standard "growth" stock yet because revenue is currently $0 while on maintenance. If you're holding, you're betting on the **2026/27 spodumene price recovery**.
