**To: Palantir Technical Operations Team**
**Re: Application for Systems Engineer – Business Systems**

Dear Palantir Hiring Team,

Palantir builds software for the world’s most critical institutions. For the past six years, I have been building the "operating systems" for one of Australia’s most critical industries: mining. I am writing to express my strong interest in the **Systems Engineer** role within your Technical Operations group.

Currently, as the Technical Lead at **Hancock Iron Ore**, I serve as the lead architect and product owner for **DASH** (Digital Automation & Service Hub). DASH is not just a tool; it is the central nervous system for a 200-FTE procurement department managing over **$7.5 billion AUD in annual spend**. 

My work mirrors the Palantir philosophy of turning fragmented, legacy enterprise data into actionable intelligence. Key highlights of my tenure that align with this role include:

*   **Building the Agentic Layer:** I independently engineered **OpenIndex**, a full-stack framework for managing AI Agent tasks and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) interactions. By leveraging RAG and custom self-correction loops—where agents ingest validation errors directly from the **SAP S/4HANA** GUI to autonomously fix data entries—I have captured over **$100 million in annual value**.
*   **Operational Transformation:** Partnering directly with the Department GM, I lead the functional transformation of our teams. I have moved our department away from manual triage toward a "Case Manager" model, where 190+ FTEs oversee agent-processed workflows, automating over **40,000 requests per year**.
*   **Bidirectional Systems Integration:** I designed and developed the live API integrations between **ServiceNow, Databricks, and SAP**, enabling real-time "write-back" capabilities that provide the executive team with a high-fidelity source of truth for ROI and departmental health.

While my background is rooted in the mining sector, the engineering challenges I solve—scaling infrastructure, enforcing guardrails on unstructured data, and aligning technology directly with business outcomes—are industry-agnostic. My experience as a co-founder of **Digit AI** further demonstrates my drive to build secure, high-performance systems from the ground up.

I am an Australian citizen relocating to the UK and will have **3-year work authorization** via the Youth Mobility Scheme. I am ready to bring my "Forward Deployed" mindset to Palantir’s internal operations and help expand the impact of Foundry and AIP across your business systems.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experience in building agentic business systems can contribute to Palantir’s mission.

Sincerely,

**Matt Savich**
